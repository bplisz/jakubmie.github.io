### About us
The 3P-Medicine Laboratory (personalized, preventive, precision) is a new science center specializing in research on acquired genetic mutations as risk factors for cancer and other diseases. Our center is focused on somatic mutations that occur early in life in seemingly normal cells that eventually contribute to malignant transformation. As a computational group we are focuced on application and/or generation computational and statistical methods to answer clinically relevant questions. We work closely with physicians at GUMed and our parter hospitals. Our research focuses on interactions between chromatin formation and environment. We use computational and molecular biology approaches. The long-term goal is to understand how mutational processes and extracellular stimulations induce alterations in chromatin structure and gene regulatory programs that lead to modified cellular states.
